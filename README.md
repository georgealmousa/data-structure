# data-structure
n this example, we create a LinkedList of type String and add some elements to it using the add() method.
We also demonstrate how to insert elements at the beginning or end of the list using the addFirst() and addLast() methods, 
and how to remove elements from the beginning or end of the list using the removeFirst() and removeLast() methods.
LinkedLists also provide several other methods for manipulating the list, such as getFirst() and getLast() for retrieving the first and last elements, get() and set() for accessing and modifying specific elements in the list, 
and contains() for checking if the list contains a specific element.

It's important to note that LinkedLists are not as efficient as arrays when it comes to accessing and modifying elements at specific indices, because they require traversing the list to find the element. However, they are much more efficient at inserting and removing elements from the list, 
because they only require updating the references in the nodes at the beginning or end of the list.
